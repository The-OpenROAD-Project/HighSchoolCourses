**Notes:** This is a comment from @dralabeing that I need to follow up on, where to add some more timing analysis: **Timing analysis is generally done at different stages- first time pre-layout after CTS, post-global-routing, after detailed routing and chip finishing. So this topic can be introduce sooner.**
